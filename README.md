# Startup Performance Prediction using Multiple Regression

## Overview:

This project applies multiple regression analysis to predict the profitability of startup companies based on various factors. Multiple regression, a form of supervised learning, is utilized to predict profit based on Research and Development Spending, Marketing Spending, State, and Administrative Costs.

## Methodology:

### Data Processing:
Categorical data is cleaned and encoded to prepare it for analysis.

### Model Training:
The data is fitted into a multiple linear regression model.

### Feature Selection:
Lasso regression is performed to select important features.

### Model Evaluation:
The trained model is deployed on test data, achieving a high accuracy of 98%.

## Conclusion:

Based on the results, it can be inferred that multiple regression is effective in predicting the profit of startup companies. Higher spending on Marketing and Research and Development correlates with increased profitability.
